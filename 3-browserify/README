To run this code:

  npm install -g browserify
  npm install
  browserify app.js -o bundle.js

Then just open index.html in your browser.

You can require node modules, as well as any of the standard node
libraries listed here:

Many of the node standard libraries which rely on IO don't work
but by writing your library with this in mind you can abstract out the
file access into an external library with one version for the browser
and another for the server.
